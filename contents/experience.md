- Mean-Field Particle System and Propagation of Chaos (Final Year Project)                     10/2024 - Present
• Supervisor: Prof. Lim Tau Shean at XMUM
• Analyzed entropy convergence of regular n-particle system and mean-field n-particle system
• Understand concentration inequality in log-Sobolev spaces and its application to entropy convergence.

- Analysis of SGD - SBA Type Algorithm and Its Application in Noise Corrupted Cournot Games      09/2024 - 06/2025
• Supervisor: Prof. Zhu WeiMing at HKU
• Analyzed the convergence of a coupling of two different stochastic algorithms, stochastic gradient descent and stochastic bisection, identified as a Bregman proximal alternating method
• Numerical test on Noise Corrupted games and analysis of the relation between parameters and convergence behaviors
